-- DESIGN DESICIONS
 1)I followed laravel's 'default' way of doing things, guided by its documentation.
 2)I used postman to test my endpoints.PostMan's collection has been provided at(HappyBlog\HappyBlog.postman_collection.json)
 3)I created Seeders for all of my models resulting in the creation of at least 5 of each.
 4)Maillable is sent locally.

-- CHALLENGES I FACED
 1) Project structure: 
    Using laravel for the first time,i found myself stalling quite some times.
 2) Decomposition:
    Getting familiar with laravel's approach to model handling and its relational structures took some time.
 3) Unfamiliarity:
    Packages,using libraries.
 4) Mail Notification:
    Did not use an SMTP.

-- CHALLENGES OVERCOME
 1)striding into unfamilliar grounds:
    I overcome my main problem of  by using laravels Documentation,online guides and forums and AI assisting.
 2)Used mailable and loger to sent email locally.
